## Unreal Engine

Unreal is a complete games development environment, in many ways very similar to Unity. It essentially does most of the things that Unity does and they are fairly interchangeable.

- It has sort of nice user interface for creating scenes.
- It has full support for the VR in most of the engines as Unity does.

The difference with unity is that Unity started off really very much aimed at indie developers, small scale independent developers whereas Unreal was aiming at high end studios.

So unreal has higher quality graphics than Unity.

If you're working in mobile VR, there's not going be worth the difference between the two.

It's not as quite as approachable as Unity, though it does have the advantage of a built in graphical scripting environment, so you don't have to write scripts in code. 

The biggest downside is that the community is not quite so large, so there aren't quite so many resources available to help you learn Unreal.

# Unity 3D

It's a multiplatform game engine created in 2004 and launched in 2005 by unity technologies. One of their main focuses was to create a platform for developers and designers of all different levels to create amazing game content and interactive experiences. 

Unity 3D also has support for virtual reality development and augmented reality development. 

Unity is a fantastic, versatile development tool, very popular with indie games and also with AAA game developers.

### reasons for using Unity 3D:-

- Unity has a great user-friendly interface. It's versatile, intuitive visual editor allows for fluid development and modification of your game.

- Unity has a Vibrant online community. Whether you want to share your progress, you can look for collaborators or just to ask a question on the forum, it's a great place to interact with other users and developers. Unity also has a great database for tutorials and documentations where you can look for the functionality that you can use to develop your game.

- Unity 3D has a multiplatform support, meaning that you can deploy to a variety of different platforms. So you can deploy it to a mobile phone, the web, or even to your console.

- Unity also plays nice with a lot external assets. So to add more functionality to Unity and add a unique twist to your game, you can download plugins and toolkits to use during your development.

## 3D space

Everything on a computer really has to be represented as numbers. Even something like an image, or a video, is broken down into vast quantities of little numbers, several for each pixel. If you think about a computer screen, it's made up a massive number of pixels, rows and rows, and rows of pixels but they essentially make up a grid.

### User Interface

- **Scene View** - This shows what's actually in the current scene that you're working in and it gives you a 3D view of what's going on. On a brand new scene, there are one or two objects. They are light and camera.

- **Hierarchy window** - The Hierarchy window contains a list of every GameObject in the current Scene . Some of these are direct instances of Asset files (like 3D models), and others are instances of Prefabs , which are custom  GameObjects that make up most of your game. When you add or remove GameObjects the Scene, they appear and disappear from the Hierarchy as well. By default, the Hierarchy window lists GameObjects by order of creation, with the most recently created GameObjects at the the bottom. You can re-order the GameObjects by dragging them up or down, or by making them “child” or “parent” GameObjects.

- **Inspector** - Projects in the Unity Editor are made up of multiple GameObjects that contain scripts, sounds, Meshes, and other graphical elements such as Lights. The Inspector window (sometimes referred to as “the Inspector”) displays detailed information about the currently selected GameObject, including all attached components and their properties, and allows you to modify the functionality of GameObjects in your Scene.

- **Game View** - The Game View is rendered from the Camera(s) in your game. It is representative of your final,published game. You will need to use one or more Cameras to control what the player actually sees when they are playing your game. For more information about Cameras.

- **Project Window** - The left panel of the browser shows the folder structure of the project as a hierarchical list. When a folder is selected from the list by clicking, its contents will be shown in the panel to the right. You can click the small triangle to expand or collapse the folder, displaying any nested folders it contains. Hold down Alt while you click to expand or collapse any nested folders recursively.
The Window menu provides the option of switching to a one-column version of the project view, essentially just the hierarchical structure list without the icon view. The lock icon next to the menu enables you to “freeze” the current contents of the view (ie, stop them being changed by events elsewhere) in a similar manner to the inspector lock. 

## Navigation in Unity

There's two ways to navigate in your scene view in Unity:

- By using gizmo
- By using hand-tool

The scene gizmo controls the orbit of our scene view, so we have the y-axis, the left axis, and the z-axis. So by clicking each one we can change the view of the scene. And the center square centers it, centers the view.
